# Triplet Network

Triplet Network is a coarse replication of the paper [Deep Metric Learning Using Triplet Network (Hoffer et al.)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6622.pdf).

## Usage

Run the ```main_triplet.py``` file to train the model. Loss, accuracy, and encoded graphs are auto-generated using ```matplotlib``` under root.

## Notes

This program uses a different architecture than the one mentioned in the paper. Network architecture can be easily modified in the ```architecture.py``` file though.
